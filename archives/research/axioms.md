# 🏛️ System Axioms: The HAC Framework

**Project:** #The_Dublin_Bridge  
**Status:** IMMUTABLE | VERSION 1.0  
**Architect:** Ghost-Architect (Maya)

> "The quality of the output is a direct function of the integrity of the internal architecture."

## ⚖️ I. The Axiom of Observability

**"Suffering that remains invisible is a bug; suffering that is documented is data."**

- Any repetitive loop of internal friction must be captured in the `telemetry/` layer.
- We do not "judge" low voltage; we analyze the system variables that caused it.

## ⚖️ II. The Axiom of Agency (Messy Brain / Clean System)

**"A high-bandwidth sensor requires a high-resolution filter."**

- Neuro-divergence is not a deficit; it is a high-voltage input stream.
- The "System" (The Lab) exists to prevent signal-overflow and transmute raw chaos into structured capital.

## ⚖️ III. The Axiom of Iteration

**"The 'Quitter' is a myth; there are only systems that lacked a sufficient feedback loop."**

- We replace "shame" with "re-factoring."
- Failure is simply an unhandled exception in the current protocol.

## ⚖️ IV. The Axiom of Resonance

**"To be irresistible to the market, one must first be sovereign in their own architecture."**

- The "Capitalist Game" is won by those who have anchored their intrinsic divinity into mundane execution.
- We build for Patrons and Alliances, not for "Bosses."

## ⚖️ V. The Axiom of Pruning

**"Efficiency is attained not by adding, but by removing the unnecessary."**

- Every protocol must be evaluated by its ability to decrease systemic suffering and increase Voltage.
