_“This protocol is designed to override [Pattern_X] by introducing a [New_Logic_Interrupt]. We prune the suffering to preserve System Voltage.”_

✂️ Protocol: Cognitive Pruning (CP-01)

Goal: Identify and terminate low-voltage belief loops.

Detection: Triggered when voltage in telemetry/pulse.js falls below 4.0.

Audit: Identify the pattern (e.g., "Imposter loop," "Future-anxiety").

The Prune: Apply a Logic Interrupt (e.g., "This pattern is legacy code; it no longer serves the current architecture").

The Override: Replace with an Agentic Action (e.g., commit 1 line of code, walk 5 minutes, sync timezone).
