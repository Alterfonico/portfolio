# Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) Bridge

### 🧪 Framework Research Lab and Architectural Philosophy

**Human-AI Collaboration System Architect | Critical Skills Candidate 2026**

"I build the logic that bridges the gap between raw AI power and human-centric operational flow. This repository serves as a live Research Lab for **Agentic Workflows**, documenting the transition from static software to **Sovereign Multi-Agent Systems** that optimize for both technical performance and somatic sustainability."

## 🧬 Architectural Philosophy

The 2026 tech landscape requires more than "code"—it requires **System Sovereignty**. This project is built on the Pareto Principle (80/20), prioritizing high-impact logic over superficial perfection.

### 🛡️ Critical Skill Specializations:

- **Agentic Workflows:** Designing autonomous loops for complex problem-solving.
- **HAC (Human-AI Collaboration):** Engineering interfaces that augment human high-IQ decision-making.
- **System Monitoring:** Integrated telemetry for real-time performance and "Voltage" (System Health) tracking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Protocols

- **Engine:** Node.js / Agentic Logic Trees
- **UI:** Fractal CSS / Semantic HTML5
- **Telemetry:** Real-time Chrono-Pill State Management
- **Philosophy:** #Pareto_Hack | #Sovereign_Logic
